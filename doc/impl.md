# Implementation

## Overview
The implementation aims to fulfill the following goals:
* Small memory usage within a fixed-sized memory region — no mallocs
* Practical for small scripts (extension scripts, config files)
* Concise source — less than 1000 loc
* Portable ANSI C (Windows, Linux, DOS — 32 and 64bit)
* Simple and easy to understand source
* Simple and easy to use C API

The language offers the following:
* Numbers, symbols, strings, pairs, lambdas, macros, cfuncs, ptrs
* Lexically scoped variables
* Closures
* Variadic functions
* Mark and sweep garbage collector
* Stack traceback on error


## Memory
The implementation uses a fixed-sized region of memory supplied by the user when
creating the `context`. The implementation stores the `context` at the start of
this memory region and uses the rest of the region to store `object`s.


## Objects
All data is stored in fixed-sized `object`s. Each `object` consists of a `car`
and `cdr`. The lowest bit of an `object`'s `car` stores type information — if
the `object` is a `PAIR` (cons cell) the lowest bit is `0`, otherwise it is `1`.
The second-lowest bit is used by the garbage collector to mark the object and is
always `0` outside of the `collectgarbage()` function.

Pairs use the `car` and `cdr` as pointers to other `object`s. As all
`object`s are at least 4byte-aligned we can always assume the lower two
bits on a pointer referencing an `object` are `0`.

Non-pair `object`s store their full type in the first byte of `car`.

##### String
Strings are stored using multiple `object`s of type `STRING` linked together —
each string `object` stores a part of the string in the bytes of `car` not used
by the type and gc mark. The `cdr` stores the `object` with the next part of
the string or `nil` if this was the last part of the string.

##### Symbol
Symbols store a pair object in the `cdr`; the `car` of this pair contains a
`string` object, the `cdr` part contains the globally bound value for the
symbol. Symbols are interned.

##### Number
Numbers store a `Number` in the `cdr` part of the `object`. By default
`Number` is a `float`, but any value can be used so long as it is equal
or smaller in size than an `object` pointer. If a different type of
value is used, `fe_read()` and `fe_write()` must also be updated to
handle the new type correctly.

##### Prim
Primitives (built-ins) store an enum in the `cdr` part of the `object`.

##### CFunc
CFuncs store a `CFunc` pointer in the `cdr` part of the `object`.

##### Ptr
Ptrs store a `void` pointer in the `cdr` part of the `object`. The handler
functions `gc` and `mark` are called whenever a `ptr` is collected or marked by
the garbage collector — the set `fe_CFunc` is passed the object itself in place
of an arguments list.


## Environments
Environments are stored as association lists, for example: an environment with
the symbol `x` bound to `10` and `y` bound to `20` would be
`((x . 10) (y . 20))`. Globally bound values are stored directly in the `symbol`
object.


## Macros
Macros work similar to functions, but receive their arguments unevaluated and
return code which is evaluated in the scope of the caller. The first time a
macro is called the code which called it is replaced by the generated code, such
that the macro itself is only ran once in each place it is called. For example,
we could define the following macro to increment a value by one:

```clojure
(= incr
  (mac (sym)
    (list '= sym (list '+ sym 1))))
```

And use it in the following while loop:

```clojure
(= i 0)
(while (< i 0)
  (print i)
  (incr i))
```

Upon the first call to `incr`, the program code would be modified in-place,
replacing the call to the macro with the code it generated:

```clojure
(= i 0)
(while (< i 0)
  (print i)
  (= i (+ i 1)))
```

Subsequent iterations of the loop would run the new code which now exists where
the macro call was originally.


## Garbage Collection
A simple mark-and-sweep garbage collector is used in conjunction with a
`freelist`. When the `context` is initialized a `freelist` is created from all
the `object`s. When an `object` is required it is popped from the `freelist`. If
there are no more `object`s on the `freelist` the garbage collector does a full
mark-and-sweep, pushing unreachable `object`s back to the `freelist`, thus
garbage collection may occur whenever a new `object` is created.

The `context` maintains a `gcstack` — this is used to protect `object`s which
may not be reachable from being collected. These may include, for example:
`object`s returned after an eval, or a list which is currently being constructed
from multiple pairs. Newly created `object`s are automatically pushed to this
stack.


## Error Handling
If an error occurs the `fe_error()` function is called — this function resets
the `context` to a safe state and calls the `error` handler if one is set. The
error handler function is passed the error message and list representing the
call stack (*both these values are valid only for this function*). The error
handler can be safely longjmp'd out of to recover from the error and use of the
`context` can continue — this can be seen in the REPL. New `object`s should not
be created from inside the error handler.

If no error handler is set or if the error handler returns then the error
message and callstack are printed to `stderr` and `exit` is called with the
value `EXIT_FAILURE`.


## Known Issues
The implementation has some known issues; these exist as a side effect of trying
to keep the implementation terse, but should not hinder normal usage:

* The garbage collector recurses on the `CAR` of objects thus deeply nested
  `CAR`s may overflow the C stack — an object's `CDR` is looped on and will not
  overflow the stack
* Proper tailcalls are not implemented — `while` can be used for iterating over
  lists
* Strings are null-terminated and therefor not binary safe
